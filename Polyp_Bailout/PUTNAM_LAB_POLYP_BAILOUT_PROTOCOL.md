# Materials
- bone cutters
- carboy for seawater mixing

    - ambient salinity seawater (35 psu)
    - high salinity seawater (64 psu)

- [Apex Fusion cloud Apex control](https://www.neptunesystems.com/apex-fusion/)
- [apex dos](https://www.neptunesystems.com/dos/) or [other dosing pump] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014KKCILE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- pH probe
- conductivity (salinity) probe
- temperature probe

- [polyp bailout chamber 118ml with 4 sides and bottom covered with 153µm mesh](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PCJ8T6G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- hot glue gun

# Steps
1. Rinse tank in freshwater to clean. Fill 4L of the tank with artificial seawater (salinity = 35 psu) leaving 2L of space for mixing high salinity water (64psu) to get to desired 50psu.
2. Add pump to the tank.
3. Attach (ziptie) tubing coming from the high salinity DOS head around the pump such that the solution will be delivered directly into the pump inflow and be mixed immediately.
4. Program DOS to add 60 mL of high salinity seawater (64 psu) every 30 minutes. This increases salinity by 0.92 psu/hour. This means you'll need to dos for about ~15 hours
- NOTE: don't forget to program the dos to stop dosing after 15 hours so the tank will not overflow.
5. Add a ~5mm *Pocillopora damicornis* fragment into a mesh settlement chamber.
- NOTE: the coral frag is in the mesh settlement chamber so the micropropagules (bailed out polyps) don't get caught in the pump.
- **to make bailout chamber**: take a small tupperware container and cut out most of the sides and bottom. Attach 153µm mesh around each hole with hot glue so the fragments can receive water flow. Secure mesh around the tupperware (with holes) using a hot glue gun. Soak the container in freshwater for 24h to remove any plastic or glue leechate.
6. After bailout occurs, move the settlement chambers with coral fragments into a seawater tank at 34psu. 

# Checkpoints
- 0hr ~35psu
- 15hr ~50psu - check for bailout
- 24hr ~50psu - check for bailout
- 48hr ~50psu - check for bailout

"high-salinity artificial seawater (48‰) was pumped into the experimental tank at a constant rate of 4 mL min−1 using a peristaltic pump"
"partial polyp detachment (an indicator of onset of polyp bail-out) was observed in the treatment group at 46.0‰ salinity (24 h) and bailed-out polyps could be easily removed from the skeleton by gently shaking the coral fragment in water, we collected both undetached coral tissues (whole fragment including undetached polyps, remaining coenosarc, and underlying skeleton; T46.0-U) and detached polyps (10–15 completely detached polyps, collected with a large-bore pipette; T46.0-D) separately."

"Total dissociation of all polyps in a given colony, however, required 2 to 3 d. There was some sloughing of remaining coenosarc tissue at this time. Almost any water movement accelerated the dissociation of polyps and coenosarc. Transferring portions of colonies to clean seawater after polyp bail-out had begun did not appear to slow the phenomenon."

"a small (∼5 mm) branch tip is removed from the mother colony using a clean stainless-steel bone cutter. The branch tip is placed in an open glass Petri dish filled with filtered artificial seawater (FASW) just covering the coral fragment. A gradual increase in salinity due to water evaporation results in a polyp-bail-out response, with separate polyps released from the coral skeleton. Polyp release can be expedited by gently pipetting or stirring the water around the coral fragment. Precise conditions for the different coral species used here differed as detailed in the text. A 5-mm fragment from the corals P. damicornis or S pistillata typically yields 30–40 micropropagates. Expelled micropropagates are transferred to a small Petri dish containing FASW at ambient salinity for up to 10 min for initial recovery. Micropropagates are then screened for viability using a stereo-microscope, and scored by observing tissue integrity, the extension of mesenterial filaments and the presence of vortical ciliary flows"
