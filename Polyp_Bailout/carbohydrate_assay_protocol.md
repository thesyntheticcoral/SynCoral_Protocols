# Dubois carbohydrate Protocol from Dr. Chris Wall (Gates Lab, HIMB)

## Extraction overview:
Using airbrushed tissue “blastate,” freeze an aliquot (1 mL or 2mL; see methods) at -80°C in screw top microcentrifuge tubes. Alternatively, keep samples on ice and measure immediately. Tissue slurry is added to concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and carbohydrates are dehydrated, creating fufural derivatives. These derivatives can be bound to phenol to create color, or measured at UV in absence of phenol.
- **NOTE: will not have blastate for most samples, will have to test # of micropropagules needed for reaction**
* Dilutions of 1:1 necessary for all samples, a 1:3 is best approach and 1:4 may be needed for some select samples.
* 0.001%, 0.002%, 0.004% solutions are good working standards. 0.005 % is ~ 1.0 absorbance * for standards: 0.01g D-glucose in 100 ml DI =0.01 % standard solution *NOTE: table of mg glucos standard + mL DI water is in PDF from Chris*
* Standardization: total mg protein, or to surface area. Ash-free dry weight may be viable option, but beware of NaCl and inorganics in blastate. *NOTE: we will be standardizing by mg protein*

## Materials General:
- UV and VIS light spectrophotometer >15mL test tubes
- glass cuvettes
- chemwipes
- vortex
- water bath (room temp)
- 10 mL glass pipettes
- 1 mL plastic pipette tips and pipetteman
- waste receptacle for H2SO4 and H2SO4 + phenol
- Milli-Q water
- 5% phenol in water (w/w)
- (>)95% concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) D-glucose: analytical reagent grade
Method

## Materials: Per sample
- 10 mL glass pipettes for H2SO4
- 1 mL plastic pipette tips for tissue

## Steps
1. Remove tissue from coral colony/fragment with air brush. Homogenize sample with tissue homogenizer for 30sec and centrifuge at 1500 x g for 3 min. **NOTE: will need to determine # of micropropagules and dilution to use**
2. Decant supernatant (= host tissue) into falcon tube (15 or 50 mL), and carefully wash algal pellet with FSW. The algal pellet can be resuspended and pelleted 1-2 times for effective washing and used for assay (pigment, cell counts)
3. Vortex supernatant (host) slurry and divide into aliquots for assay (lipid, carbs, protein); residual sample can be frozen at -80°C.
4. 2mL of tissue slurry is used for carbohydrate assay
a. Phenol-H2SO4 method (DuBois et al. 1956)
5. Dubois method:
  a. 2 mL of slurry (i.e., carbohydrate sample) is mixed with 1 mL 5% phenol in
water (w/w) in test tube (~15 mL). 5 mL of concentrated H2SO4 is rapidly added to the slurry/phenol mixture, and let stand for 10 min. For better mixing: add stream of acid added against liquid surface rather than the side of test tube. ** Note that tube will get very hot for 10-15 seconds as dehydration reaction occurs
  b. vortex for 30 seconds, and place in room temp (20°C) water bath for 20 min for color development.
  c. Measure light absorption on a spectrophotometer (glass cuvettes) at 490 or 485nm against DI blank (some discrepancy as to which to use, 485nm is most common)
  d. Reference material produced in identical manner, with 2 mL Mili-Q water for a blank and stock carbohydrates (i.e., D-glucose or others...) to produce a concentration vs. absorbance standard curve. To make carbohydrate stock, add 0.1g of dry carbohydrate in 1 L of Milli-Q water to get 100mg/L solution.
  e. Waste disposal: 0.06% phenol, 56% H2SO4 in ~43% water * Note 490 nm is used for hexose, and 480 nm for pentose and uronic acids
