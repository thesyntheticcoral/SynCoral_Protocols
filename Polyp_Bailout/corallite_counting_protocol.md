# Corallite counting protocol for polyp bailout experiments!
Rationale: Counting # of corallites per Pocillopora acuta fragment will allow us to normalize the number of micropropagules released per # of corallites (total possible micropropagules that could be released). This is in lieu of normalizing to surface area and/or skeleton weight.

**Materials**
- Sharpie
- Lab notebook
- small plastic bag
- coral fragment

**Steps**
1. Remove (dried) coral fragment from plastic bag. **NOTE:** coral should be labelled with trial start date YYYYMMDD and fragment ID
2. In your lab notebook write today's date (YYYYMMDD) and set up the table below.
| Trial start date (YYYYMMDD) | Fragment ID | total # corallites |  
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| YYYYMMDD | POC-# |  |
| YYYYMMDD | POC-# |  |
| YYYYMMDD | POC-# |  |
3. For each fragment, draw a dot in each corallite as you count.  
![Here is a close up diagram of what a corallite looks like. Note this is a different coral species](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Diagram-showing-the-difference-of-corallite-calice-and-corallum_fig2_277666584)

4. After you count, record the number of corallites counted in the lab notebook. Place fragment in bag labelled with trial start date (YYYYMMDD) and fragment ID for data archiving purposes
5. When you are done counting for the morning/ afternoon/ day, transcribe counts into csv and push to github.
