<a name="Initial"></a>**Initial Setup**

Setting up the respirometry system for the first time in a new place:

1. Suspend AI lights above each bin, following the [(AI Light Protocol)](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-03-18-AI-Lights.md) for set up instructions.
2. To control the AI light settings:
	* Download the myAI® app on a compatible iOS or Android phone. 
        * Follow the [(AI Lights Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-03-18-AI-Lights.md) for setup and useage instructions. 
3. Place a respirometry stand into each bin. 
4. Using the apogee quantum meter to measure light levels at each position, adjust the placement of the bin, stand, and AI lights as necessary to attain desired light intensities. Ideally, light levels should be as equal as possible across the different positions on the 2 stands. 
5. Once finished, mark the position of the bins and the stands using electrical tape. Record the AI light settings and position combinations required to obtain each desired light intensity required for the PI curves.

    **In Mo'orea, E5 March, September, and November 2020 timepoints desired light intensities and percentages recorded below**

<a name="Bath"></a> **Water Bath Setup**

1. Fill the bins with source water, enough to just fully submerge the chambers once the chambers are placed inside.
2. Measure and record the temperature and salinity of the source water (i.e., in the water table where the coral are kept). 
3. Place an aquarium pump and a heater into each bin. **The pump(s) and heater(s) must be fully submerged before powering on.** Plug in each piece of equipment, making sure the outlets have an appropriate voltage. Adjust the temperature of the bins so that they approximate the water temperature experienced by the coral being measured.  
4. While you wait for the bath and source water to reach the desired temperature, set up the respirometer and prepare the chambers.  

<a name="Battery"></a> **Connecting the Battery**

1. Unscrew the cap of the sealed battery compartment on the underside of the stand and locate the red and black cables.  Attach the red clip to the positive terminal (marked in red) on the battery and the black clip to the negative terminal (marked in black).  Test your connection and battery power by turning the switch on the other side of battery compartment **clockwise**.  The conveyor belt should start moving at a quick pace.  Turn the switch off.  
	* If the belt does not move or moves slowly, the battery needs to be switched out and recharged.  
2. As an additional check, you can unscrew a chamber base, insert a stir bar in the center divet of the base, then reseal the chamber.  Place the chamber in one of the chamber slots and note the rotation speed of the stir bar.  If the stir bar is spinning slowly or not at all, the battery needs to be switched out and recharged.  
3. Place the connected battery inside the compartment **gently** and screw the lid on tightly, making sure the o-ring is properly positioned. Using a strap wrench may be necessary to obtain a tight seal. 
	* The connection point of the black wire is very delicate.  Rough handing or too much tension on the wires from twisting may disconnect the wire from its base, requiring soldering to reattach the the metal foot of the wire to the metal point on the base.  
4.  Once the battery is placed inside, and everything is sealed, do one last check of power to make sure the motor is running, then turn it off to conserve the battery until you're ready to start your runs.
5. Once you are sure the battery compartment is water tight, submerge the respirometer in the bin.  


<a name="Chambers"></a> **Filling and Securing Chambers**

1. Unscrew the bottom from each chamber and place a magnetic stir bar in the center divet. Submerge the chamber top and bottom and shake off or wipe away any air bubbles.  
	* If including organisms, secure them in the bottom of the chamber if possible without crushing the coral
	* If the coral fragment will not fit in the bottom, carefully balance it on the black platform
	* Fill the chambers in a random order, but try to include an equal representation of coral species for each respirometry run. 
	* Leave one chamber filled with only water and no coral. This will serve as the blank.
2. Screw the top and bottom of the chamber together. The chambers are easily cross-threaded, so if you feel friction, try again. Screw the chambers together until **finger tight**. Check again for bubbles and remove any as necessary. Leave submerged until they are ready to secure on the respirometer stand.
3. Record the identify of the coral fragment or the blank with its corresponding chamber number.   
4. Use the screw key to loosen the bolts of the holding plates on the stand just until the plates are moveable. 
5. When you are ready to place the chambers in the stand, use your thumb to cover the holes (for the temperature and oxygen probes) that are in the top of the chamber. Move and gently place the chambers in a random position in the stand. Record the position of each chamber.
6. Turn the power switch **clockwise** to turn on, and check for proper stir bar placement.  If any stir bars are not spinning or are out of place, gently jiggle the chamber until the bar is reset.       
7. Tighten the screws of the stand, making sure the holding plates are over the chamber lips.  

<a name="Probes"></a> **Inserting Oxy-10 Probes**

1. All of the temperature probes and oxygen probes are numbered. The probe numbers should match the number of the chamber, **not** the position number.
2. Careful to not damage the probes or introduce bubbles to the chamber, insert the temperature probe into the larger probe port and gently guide it down until it fits snuggly and securely. Approximately half of the probe should be in the chamber without it touching the coral.  
3. Gently guide the oxygen probe into its port, being careful to not scratch the probe tip. The probe tip should be at least 2 cm into the chamber, but can be inserted farther, as long as the probe isn't touching any organisms or objects in the chamber. **Note** The oxygen probe may need to be inserted deeping into the chamber so that its cord is not touching the Ocean Revive lights. The oxygen probes use fiberoptic cables that can melt and be damaged by the heat of the lights. **Double check that the oxygen probe cables are never touching the Ocean Revive lights.**
4. Check for bubbles inside the chambers.  If any bubbles are present, try to remove them.  
	* You may be able to guide small bubbles out of the airlock seal on the chamber lid.  
	* For large bubbles or a large quantity of bubbles, remove the chamber, place back into the source water, unscrew the bottom to wipe or shake away any bubbles, then close and re-secure the chamber.

<a name="Presens"></a> **Enter Sample IDs into PreSens**

1. In the PreSens program, navigate to the "Measurements" tab
2. Click "New" and enter in a sample ID name. Sample names should include the species ID name (or blank), number, and date. 
	* Example name for coral: ACR-254_20200105
	* Example name for blank: BK-4_20200105
3. 	After entering the sample name, click the name of the sample and click the corresponding channel you wish to assign it to. Click the "Assign to" button to assign the channel to the sample. **Each sample should only be assigned to 1 channel!**

<a name="Final_Checks"></a> **Final Checks**

Last checks before starting to record data using the PreSens program:  

1. Stir bars should be spinning in place and at normal speed (If not, the battery needs to be switched out and recharged - see [**Take-Down**](#Take-Down) instructions for proper procedures)  
2. Chambers are securely fastened on the respirometer stand  
3. No bubbles are present inside the chambers  
4. The correct probes are in the correct chambers (Every numbered temperature probe is with its corresponding oxygen probe and in the chamber you've assigned to the probe pair)  


<a name="Data"></a> **Collecting the Data**

1.  The first light level is 0. Turn off the lights in the room during this measurement.
2. Navigate to the "Live View" tab.
3. Select Channel 1 in the PreSens software. Click "Start." Continue through each channel, starting the data collection. Each channel must be started individually. Verify that all channels have been started. Record the start time. 
4. After 10 minutes, click "Stop" for each channel. Record the stop time. 
5. Adjust the light settings to the desired intensity. 
6. Restart the data collection only after 2 or more minutes has passed since stopping the previous measurement.
	* **Helpful tip**: Approximately 20-30 minutes before the end of the respirometry run (i.e., during the 8th light intensity level) begin preparing the reservoir water for the calcifaction measurement according the to [Instantaneous Calcification Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Instantaneous-Calcification-Protocol.md)
7. **As soon as the data for the final light intensity has been collected, export and save the data.** To export the data
	* Navigate to the "Measurements" tab
	* Highlight all of the samples from the current respiration run
	* Click "Export"
	* For each sample, select the target by clicking "Browse"
	* Navigate to where you would like to save the file
	* Change the file type to a .csv and click "Save"
	* Each sample must be individually directed to the target location and saved as a .csv
	* Click "Export"
	* Once the export has finished, save all files to the Google Drive

<a name="Removing"></a> **Removing Chambers from Respirometer**

1. Remove the probes and carefully place or drape them in a secure location.  
2. Unscrew the holding plates and remove a chamber.  
3. Unscrew the airlock seal on the lid (best method for pouring the water into another container) and pour the water into the graduated cylinder. Record the volume. 
4. Immediately proceed to the [Instantaneous Calcification Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Instantaneous-Calcification-Protocol.md), keeping the coral out of seawater for as little time as possible
    

<a name="Take-Down"></a> **Respirometer Take-Down and CleanUp**

1. Turn off the stir bars by turning the switch beneath the stand **counter-clockwise**.
2. Take the stand out of the water bath  
	* When lifting the stand out of the bath, keep it tilted slightly so that the lid to the battery compartment is lower than the opposite side with the power switch. If any water seeped into the battery compartment, this will force the water away from other electrical components of the compartment. 
	* Rinse the stand with fresh water
	* Unscrew the battery compartment, remove the battery, and charge it. 
	* Use tape to label the battery when it is fully charged, including the date it was charged.
3. Using a isopropanol wipe, wipe down the cord of each Oxy-10 probe to remove any remaining salt deposits or particulates, then recoil the probes and store them in a secure place.   
4. Rinse all chambers and stir bars with fresh water and let them dry overnight.  
5. Empty the seawater from the respirometry bins
6. Take down, wipe the cables with isopropanol wipes, and securely store the AI lights
