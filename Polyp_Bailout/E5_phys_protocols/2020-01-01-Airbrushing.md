2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**


	1. Remove coral fragment from dry shipper or freezer 
	2. Use forceps to place coral fragment in labeled ziplock bag (quart size)
	3. Airbrush with 1X PBS (pH = 7.4)  
		- Take care to remove tissue from entire surface area, including deep tissue
		- Attempt to keep total blastate volume below 50mL to fit into one falcon tube (i.e., use PBS through airbrush efficiently!). 
	4. Transfer tissue slurry from the bag to a sterile 50mL falcon tube and rinse sides of bag with 1x PBS, adding rinsate to falcon tube.
	5. Record total volume of tissue slurry and store on ice until homogenization
	6. Homogenize slurry for 30 sec in falcon tube using the [Bio-Gen PRO200 Homogenizer ](https://proscientific.com/hand-held-homogenizers/bio-gen-pro200-homogenizer/). If blastate is in multiple falcon tubes, homogenize each and pour back and forth between tubes to ensure even mixing.
	7. Between each sample, clean the forceps and the homogenizer in a 10% bleach solution for 30 seconds, DI wash #1 for 30 seconds, DI wash #2 for 30 seconds, then wipe down with an isopropanol wipe.

*****
*Store homogenized tissues on ice until ready to aliquot for downstream assays*
*****

3. **e5 downstream assays** (see flowchart below)

	- Label four 1.5-mL microcentrifgue tubes for each sample. 
	- Add 1 mL homogenized tissue blastate to two of the 1.5-mL tubes.
	- Centrifuge both 1.5-mL tubes at 13,000g for 3 min. 
	- From one tube, pipet off supernatant (~1mL) and discard.
		- *This is the chlorophyll assay tube:* The day before you run the chlorophyll assays, add 1mL acetone to resuspend the symbiont pellet, and place in 4°C fridge in LTER lab. See [chlorophyll assay](2020-01-01-Chlorophyll-Protocol.md) for more detail.
	- From second tube, pipet off supernatant and transfer to a new labeled 1.5-mL tube. *This supernatant is the host protein/TAC/LPO assay tube:* Immediately place in -40°C until ready to proceed with the [protein assay](2020-01-01-Total-Protein-Protocol.md), [total antioxidant capacity assay](2020-01-01-Total-Antioxidant-Capacity-Protocol.md), and/or lipid peroxidation assay.
	- To the second symbiont pellet, add 1mL 1xPBS to resuspend pellet. Vortex thoroughly and pipet up and down to fully dissolve pellet. 
	- Once dissolved, transfer 500 µL to a new labeled 1.5-mL tube. *This is the symbiont protein/TAC/LPO assay tube:* Immediately place in -40°C until ready to proceed with the protein, antioxidant, and/or lipid peroxidation assays (see links above).
	- The remaining 500 µL of resuspended symbionts in PBS is *the symbiont density assay tube:* Store at 4°C fridge in LTER lab until ready to count cells following the [symbiont density protocol](2020-01-01-Cell_Density-Protocol.md).
		
	- Freeze the remainder of the homogenate for Ash-free dry weight: 5 mL into a pre-burned aluminum drying pan (if ready to proceed straight away, otherwise falcon tube of homogenate can be stored at -40°C until ready).
