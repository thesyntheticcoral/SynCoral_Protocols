## Shapiro et al methods
 - species used: *Pocillopora damicornis* and *Stylophora pistillata*
 - ambient salinity: 39 ppt
 - Other parameters of interest
   - light: 200 μmol photons m−2 s−1. 12h light:dark cycle
   - aquaria size: 200-L
   - water source: filtered artificial seawater (FASW) from Reef Salts (Aqua Medic GMBH, Germany)  
 - Use sterilized bone cutters to cut a small (~5mm) branching fragment
 - place fragment in open glass petri dish with enough FASW to cover it
 - allow evaporation to occur to induce polyp bailout
 - (~12 hours later), When polyp bailout is about to occur, this can be facilitated by gently perturbing water (via pipette or gently shaking petri dish)
 - Transfer micropropagates to fresh FASW in a new petri dish for at least 10 min to recover
 - Following recover, assess micropropagate viability using a stereo-microscope to evaluate tissue integrety, mesenterial filament extension, and whether vortical ciliary flows are present.
 - NOTE: a 5mm fragment usually yields 30-40 micropropagates
 - NOTE: inducing hyperosmotic stress via evaporation may cause concentration of metabolites from coral waste in the remaining seawater. Chuang and Mitarai discuss how this could be a potentially harmful form of nutrient stress (see link to paper and protocol below).

## Shapiro et al results (*P. damicornis*)
 - Timepoint 11h: coenosarc rupturing and polyp retraction around salinity 42-45ppt.
 - Timepoint 11.5h: polyp separation/ bailout. coincides with coenosarc "severing" around 52-54ppt.
 - Timepoint 48 h: settlement
 - NOTE: this should result in the expulsion of over 90% of the polyps.
 - NOTE: if polyp bailout does not occur in Pdam, removing fragment from high salinity FASW to air exposure to 30 min and back to high salinity FASW can hasten polyp bailout.

 ## Chuang and Mitarai methods
 - species used: *Pocillopora acuta*
 - ambient salinity: 35 ppt
 - Other parameters of interest
    - light: 300 μmol photons m−2 s−1. 12h light:dark cycle
    - aquaria size: 5-L
    - water source: artificial seawater (ASW)  
    - Pump high salinity ASW (48ppt) into tank at a rate of 4mL/min.
    - Monitor temp and salinity at 0, 12, and 24 hr.
        - NOTE: salinity levels at sampling timepoints were 35ppt, 43 ppt, and 46 ppt (respectively)
    - Record morphology changes and polyp bailout via spy cam/ video recording
    - Partial polyp bailout should occur by 24 hr
    - transfer detatched polyps to control tank immediately following bailout.
    - Determine viability using stereo microscope
 - NOTE: corals were collected in Okinawa, Japan and kept in a 3,000 L outdoor aquaria for 6 months prior to experimentation
 - NOTE: "Evaporation-driven hyperosmotic treatment" reported from Shapiro et al 2016 was not used due to risks associated with concentrating coral waste

 ## Chuang and Mitarai results
 - expected salinity at timepoints 0h (35ppt), 12h (43ppt), 24hr (46ppt)
 - Timepoints 6-12h: tentacle retraction occurs as salinity increases from 40.0 to 43.0ppt
 - Timepoints 12h: thinning of coenosarc tissue as salinity reaches 43.0ppt
 - Timepoint 24h: coenosarc degrades and 30-50% of polyps bailout as salinity approaches 46ppt
 - bailed out propagules viable for at least 24h
 - Salinity in control tank varied less than 1ppt, no sign of polyp bailout
