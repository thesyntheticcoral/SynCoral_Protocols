# Cell Attachment

- [Collagen Coating Solution Protocol ](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/12550?lang=en&region=US)
The coating concentration is 1 ml per 10 cm2 surface area of the cell culture ware: 0.113 mL for coating a 12 mm diameter glass coverslip (2.5 ml for coating a T-25 flask or a 60 mm tissue culture dish;  7.5 ml for coating a T-75 flask or a 100 mm tissue culture dish). 

Add collagen coating solution to the substrate and rock gently to distribute evenly. 

Let sit for at room temperature overnight. 

Remove coating solution by aspiration in a sterile hood. 

The substrate is ready to use immediately, alternatively, it can be stored at 4°C for up to two weeks.

## Attachment test:
1. Coat the substrate to test following to step outlined above. For plastic: directly coat wells of a multi-well plate. For glass: coat a glass coverslip placed inside a well of a multi-well plate.
2. Dissociate cells using the Ca-Mg free seawater incubation (1H) method described previously and prepare the cell suspension.
3. Count cells following the method described previously
4. Add 0.5 mL of cell suspension + 0.5 mL of media to each well and incubate at 25°C for 24H.
5. After 24H, vigorously mix the solution in each well using a pipette to dislodge unattached cells.
6. Add 0.5 mL of DAPI working solution ( DAPI 1 mg [Millipore Sigma cat. no. D9542]; Stock solution = 1 mg/mL DAPI in DI water; Working solution = 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS) to each well to stain cells.
7. Count cells.
