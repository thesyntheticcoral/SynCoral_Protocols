**How to make CaMg free seawater**  
Lewinski Lab calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater mixture:  
-	23 g/L NaCl  
- 0.763 g/L KCl
- 3 g/L NaSO4
- 0.25 g/L NaHCO3

**C.** <a name="Isolation"></a> **Isolation**

1. Disinfect clippers and tweezers with 70% ethanol.
2. Remove coral fragment from tank and place in glass crystallizing dish containing tank water.
3. Cut coral nubbin (0.3-0.5 cm long) from fragment using sterilized clippers.
4. Using tweezers, carefully bring nubbin into the biosafety cabinet and place in a sterile plastic petri dish.
5. Rinse nubbin 3 times with sterile filtered artificial seawater in the petri dish.
5. Transfer rinsed nubbin to a different sterile plastic petri dish containing 5 mL of sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater.

**5.1** <a name="MechanicalScraping"></a> **Mechanical Scraping**  
- **5.1.1** Mechanically scrape nubbin using a sterile scalpel or surgical hook.
	- a. NOTE: Need to try scraping polyps only first then coenosarc as a means of separating cell types.  
	- b. NOTE: Mechanical scrapping does not remove all tissue.  Need to try enzymatic digestion of residual tissue from skeleton.
- **5.1.2** Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a 15 mL conical tube.  Rinse petri dish with 5 mL of sterile filtered calcium-magnesium free artificial seawater to collect any tissue and cells that did not transfer. Centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **5.1.3** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.
	- a. NOTE: If counting the collected cells, use a smaller volume (2 mL) to achieve a higher cell concentration for counting.

**5.2** <a name="Toothbrush"></a> **Toothbrush**  
- **5.2.1** Mechanically scrape nubbin using a toothbrush
	- a. NOTE: Need to try scraping polyps only first then coenosarc as a means of separating cell types.  
- **5.2.2** Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **5.2.3** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.
	 - Lewinski lab coral culture media recipe here: [**Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents**](#Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents)   

**5.3** <a name="Paintbrush"></a> **Paintbrush**  
- **5.3.1** Mechanically scrape nubbin using a paintbrush
	- a. NOTE: Need to try scraping polyps only first then coenosarc as a means of separating cell types.  
- **5.3.2** Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **5.3.3** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.

**5.4** <a name="Ca-Mg-free-seawater"></a> **Ca-Mg-free-seawater**  
-	**5.4.1** Incubate nubbin at 25°C for 1-3 hours in shaking incubator (rpm 30), in filtered, calcium and magnesium free, artificial seawater supplemented with 3% [Antibiotics-antimycotics solution Thermofisher #1524006](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062) solution.
-	**5.4.2** Using tweezers, transfer nubbin to a sterile Eppendorf tube and rinse nubbin using 2 mL of filtered, calcium and magnesium free, artificial seawater supplemented with 3% [Antibiotics-antimycotics solution Thermofisher #1524006](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15240062#/15240062) solution.
	- a. NOTE: An incubation of 1 hour yields on the order of 10^6 cells.
	- b. NOTE: A 3 hour incubation time does not collect all tissue.  Incubation for 2 days results in significantly more tissue harvested.
	
**D.** <a name="Incubation"></a> **Incubation**  

- **For mechanical harvesting with a medical scapel, toothbrush, or paintbrush**: timing for incubation period undetermined as of 07282020

**6.2** <a name="Trypsin"></a> **Trypsin**    
- **6.2.1**. Transfer water containing detached tissue and cells to a conical tube (15 mL) and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.  
	- NOTE: A pellet should be visible at the bottom of the conical tube.
- **6.2.2** Aspirate the supernatant  and add 2 mL of [Trypsin fishersci #25300054](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/trypsin-05-edta/25300054) to resuspend the pellet.
  - NOTE: for different trypsin concentrations: 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.125% trypsin solution. 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.025% trypsin solution.
	- NOTE: Both [trypsin] work and we need to measure the cell concentrations harvested resulting from the different concentrations.
- **6.2.3** Incubate the resuspended cell mixture for 5 minutes at 25°C then check for cell separation (e.g. primarily individual cells in suspension, little to no large cell aggregates).  If not completely digested, incubate for another 5 minutes.
- **6.2.4** Add 3 mL of coral cell media to neutralize trypsin then centrifuge cells at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes.
- **6.2.5** Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend with 5 mL of coral cell culture media.

	- NOTE: Liberase TM 2 x 5 mg (Millipore Sigma cat. no. 5401119001) – contains a blend of Collagenase I and Collagenase II and medium concentration of Thermolysin, a non-clostridial neutral protease. Reconstitute lyophilized enzyme (5mg) in 2 mL filtered artificial seawater to produce working solution **with concentration of 2.5 mg/mL liberase.**
	- NOTE: Liberase TM was selected versus Liberase DL because observation of tissue balls was not reported, suggesting cells remained dispersed after dissociation.
	 - NOTE: for different trypsin concentrations: 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.125% trypsin solution. 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin stock solution + 1 mL of filtered artificial seawater (no [HEPES Thermofisher #15630106](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-culture/mammalian-cell-culture/reagents/hepes.html)) to make 0.025% trypsin solution.

	- NOTE: Lewinski lab coral culture media recipe here: [**Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents**](#Coral-Culture-Media-Reagents)  

**E.** <a name="Incubation-Conditions"></a> **Incubation-Conditions**

**F.** <a name="Viability"></a> **Viability**  
9. Transfer 100 uL of the cell suspension to an Eppendorf tube and add 10 uL of trypan blue stain.  Mix the cell suspension with the dye.
  -   a. NOTE: Trypan blue is a mutagen – handle with care and dispose contaminated items in biohazard waste!  
10. Transfer 10 uL of the cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count the number of algae cells and coral cells noting the number of each cell type that stain blue.  
11. Count at least three 1 mm x 1 mm squares per hemocytometer side to obtain six measurements in one experiment.  
12. Report the following data:  

| Cell type | Total count | Dead count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Algae |   |     |
| Coral |   |     |

13. Calculate the cell solution concentration. C = c/d/A*f
  - C = concentration (cells/mL)
  - c = average number of cells counted (cells)
  - d = depth of hemocytometer chamber (0.1 mm)
  - A = area of hemocytometer counted (mm^2)
  - f = conversion factor (1000 mm^3/mL)
14. Securely cap Eppendorf tube and dispose of trypan blue dyed cell suspension into biohazard waste.

**G.** <a name="General-Notes"></a> **General-Notes**
- When used 1 mL PenStrep, microorganism overgrowth observed on day 2 post-harvest.  
- When scraping off cells and can use original skeleton and place in media. sometimes has less gunk.
- NOTE: currently using cell viability (% alive & % dead) for protocol assessment. In the future we could incorporate metrics beyond cell viability (e.g. cell cycle, oxidative stress, DNA damage).
- other relevant Antibiotics: Gentamicin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# G1914), Neomycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# PHR1491), Tobramycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# T1783), Kanamycin sulfate (Sigma, Cat# 60615), Levofloxacin (Sigma, Cat# 28266-10G-F), Cefepime hydrochloride (Cat#PHR1763-1G, sigma).
