# Cell Populations Separation

## Density Gradient: the protocol used was adapted from Downs et al., 2009

1. Dissociate cells using the Ca-Mg free seawater incubation (1H) method described previously and prepare the cell suspension;
2. Prepare 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5% Percoll solutions by mixing 100% Percoll with the appropriate volume of filtered artificial seawater; 
3. Refrigerate each of the eleven solutions (5-100%) for at least 30 minutes before construction of the Percoll gradient; 
4.  In a 15 mL conical tube, add 1 mL per Percoll concentration starting with 100% and working towards 10%;
5. Add 2 mL of coral cell sample to the top of the Percoll gradient;
6. Centrifuge tube at 400g (1460 rpm for swing bucket rotor) for 10 minutes.
Note: Ficoll 400 and PEG 8000 were used as additives by Downs et al. (2009) but made no difference on the outcome of our Percoll Step-Gradient cell separation tests.

## Fluorescence Activated Cell Separation
1. Dissociate cells using the Ca-Mg free seawater incubation (1H) method described previously and prepare the cell suspension;
2. Transfer cel suspension to a conical tube and centrifuge at 1200 rom for 3 minutes to pellet cells;
3. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 3 mL od DAPI working solution ( DAPI 1 mg [Millipore Sigma cat. no. D9542]; Stock solution = 1 mg/mL DAPI in DI water; Working solution = 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS) – Note: this is a short cut to stain while counting. Separate steps if anticipate cell counting will take longer than 15 minutes;
4. Count cells then centrifuge and resuspend cell pellet in volume of 1X PBS for cell concentration of 1-2 x106 cells/mL;
5. Aliquot cells as needed;
6. Filter 1 mL of cells through cell strainer into FACS tube (Corning Falcon test tube with cell strainer snap cap [Fisher Scientific cat. No. 08-771-23];
7. Store FACS tubes at 25°C until analysis (within 2H).
8. Cell sorting using FACS (based on Rosental et al. 2017):

- FACS machine used: BD FACSAria™ II High-Speed Cell Sorter with BD FACSDiva software;
- Initial gating based on forward (FSC) and side scattered (SSC) light to focus on cell signal versus cell debris. Subsequent gating aimed at separating coral host cells (green autofluorescence) from symbiotic algae cells (red autofluorescence);
- Channels used (adapted from Rosental et al. 2017): autofluorescence 640nm (780/60BP) versus DAPI 405nm (450/50BP) and autofluorescence 488 (710/50BP) versus DAPI 405nm (450/50BP).
